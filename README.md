# HousingSales
A data cleaning project of over 56,000 rows of Nashville Housing data. This project is specifically dedicated to data cleaning in SQL. In the dataset and in what is relevant to us,
this dataset gives the sale date, property address, owner address, parcel ids, inique ids, whether or not they were sold as vacant, sale price, legel reference, and tax district
for every house on the list.
